      "title": "Understanding Carbohydrates & Blood Sugar",
      "summary": "Carbohydrates break down into sugars during digestion; simple carbs (such as glucose and fructose) are digested quickly and cause rapid spikes in blood sugar, while complex carbs contain longer sugar chains and fiber, digest more slowly and cause a gradual rise【883019761669017†L96-L138】. The glycemic index ranks foods by how quickly they raise blood sugar—low‑glycemic foods (\u226455) like whole oats cause a slower rise, whereas high‑glycemic foods like white bread and potatoes cause substantial spikes【883019761669017†L147-L152】. Choosing low‑glycemic, high‑fiber carbohydrate sources helps manage blood sugar and lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease【883019761669017†L147-L169】.",
